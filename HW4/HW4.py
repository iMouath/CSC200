# Write code similar to what we did in class for printing all of the vowels in a string, but do this for consonants
# instead.  It should work for upper and lower case consonants.  I STRONGLY encourage you to use the find function we
#  introduced at the end of the class.  Consider the different ways you might use that tool and remember that it
# returns -1 when it can not find the value you are looking for.  HINT HINT!!!!

# count = 0
# s = "Hello World"
# for c in s:
#     if c in 'AaEeIiOoUu':
#         print("Vowel")
#     else:
#         print(c)
#         count += 1
#
#
# print("Number of Consonants: ", count)
